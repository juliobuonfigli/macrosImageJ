In some cases, you might need to edit the recorded macro to make it usable with other images than the one you used to record the macro with.
 Example: when you merge channels, you end up with a statement like this:
001
002	run("Merge Channels...",
    "red=[Edges of boats.gif] green=boats.gif blue=boats.gif gray=*None*");

The parameters passed to Merge Channels... depend very much on the current image's name. One possible solution looks like this:
001
002
003	title = getTitle();
run("Merge Channels...",
     "red=[Edges of " + title + "] green=" + title + " blue=" + title + " gray=*None*");

Note that we need to use string concatenation in order to insert the current image's name in place of boats.gif, as described in above.
In order to allow spaces in the name, you might also want to add extra [...] around the title:
001
002
003	title = getTitle();
run("Merge Channels...",
     "red=[Edges of " + title + "] green=[" + title + "] blue=[" + title + "] gray=*None*");
